📌 HackVerse 2026 – GitHub Submission Guidelines

To ensure fair evaluation, technical rigor, and clarity across all teams, every HackVerse 2026 submission must follow a standardized repository structure and README format.
Your GitHub repository is not just code storage — it is part of your official evaluation.

Judges will review your repository to assess:
1)Depth of problem understanding
2)System architecture and design decisions
3)Modeling and AI strategy
4)Evaluation methodology
5)Business impact and actionability
6)Reproducibility and clarity

A well-structured repository demonstrates professionalism, technical maturity, and industry readiness.

🎯 Why This Structure Matters

HackVerse 2026 is an industry-collaborative hackathon. Sponsors are evaluating not only your model performance, but also:

1)Your ability to communicate technical decisions
2)Your ability to build explainable systems
3)Your ability to translate AI into business value
4)Your ability to document work professionally

In real-world industry settings, clear documentation and reproducibility are just as important as model accuracy.

🚨 Important Requirements

All teams must:

1)Follow the official repository naming convention
2)Use the required README structure below
3)Include architecture explanation
4)Include evaluation and metrics
5)Clearly explain business impact
6)Provide reproducible instructions
7)Incomplete or poorly structured repositories may impact scoring under:
8)Data & System Design
9)Modeling Strategy
10)Evaluation & Metrics
11)Business Actionability

🏆 Submission Philosophy

Your repository should answer this question clearly:

If an industry engineer or hiring manager reads this repository, can they understand what you built, why you built it, and how to reproduce it?

If the answer is yes — you are on the right track.

📘 HackVerse 2026 – Official GitHub Submission Template

All teams must follow this structure for their final repository submission.

🔖 Repository Naming Convention (Mandatory)

Your repository must be named:

ProjectName - CompanyName
Example:
InsightFlow - Clinsight
RedditReach - LextrackAI
AgentSupport - Ricoh

Incorrect naming may result in submission penalties.

What does your system do?

What input does it take?

What output does it generate?

What makes it unique?

4️⃣ Architecture & System Design

Include:

Clear explanation of pipeline

Architecture diagram (image recommended)

Data flow description

Example structure:

User Input
   ↓
Data Processing / Retrieval Layer
   ↓
