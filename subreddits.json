Globally forgotten, we are the disaffected, eye-rolling middle children of history who raised ourselves, feral, fueled by cynicism, and commonly known as latchkey kids.  This subreddit is for Gen X by Gen X, sharing memories, stories, nostalgia, humor, photos, and commentary. Someone has to remember it all, or whatever.",
