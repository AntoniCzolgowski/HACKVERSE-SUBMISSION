You can get similar performance characteristics by layering basic merino wool or synthetic blends that cost a fraction of what Nike charges. I've been experimenting with modifying thrift store athletic wear - adding mesh panels for ventilation, reinforcing high-wear areas with proper stitching techniques.\n\nIf you're handy with a sewing machine, you can basically reverse-engineer most of their \"innovations.\" The DRI-FIT stuff is just polyester with a different weave pattern.

Some of the tech fabrics start pilling or losing their stretch after 6-8 months of heavy use.\n\nMy go-to rotation still includes some older Nike pieces from like 2018-2019 that just refuse to quit.

You can get similar performance characteristics by layering basic merino wool or synthetic blends that cost a fraction of what Nike charges.
