When you found a lefty that felt right, what was it? Did you go boutique/specialty brands, or did you manage to find something decent through the usual channels? And real talk \u2014 did you have to compromise on what you actually wanted, or did you find something that checked all your boxes?\n\nLooking to learn from people who've actually been through this instead of just guessing.",

Like, the finish work and color options they offer are actually inspired compared to the sea of boring sunburst and black guitars most companies churn out for lefties.\n\nI think a lot of brands treat left-handed models like an afterthought \u2013 same boring specs, limited colors, zero personality. Reverend actually seemed to care about the visual appeal, and when you're spending that much money on something that's going to live in your space, aesthetics matter just as much as tone IMO.\n\nHad to order online obviously, but their customer service was solid about letting me return it if the neck didn't feel right.

Back in the '80s, I bought my first serious lefty - a Gibson Les Paul Standard that I had to special order through my local shop. Took six months and cost me a premium, but that guitar is still with me today and sounds better than ever.\n\nThe difference was patience and understanding that quality instruments hold their value. I've since added a Martin D-28 lefty and a Fender Stratocaster, all purchased new from authorized dealers. Yes, you pay more upfront, but these established manufacturers know how to build instruments that last decades. \n\nMy advice? Save up for something from Gibson, Fender, or Martin rather than compromising on a budget alternative. The resale value alone justifies the investment, and you'll have an instrument that grows with you rather than something you'll want to replace in two years.",

          "body": "Honestly, I ended up getting a Reverend lefty about a year ago and what sold me wasn't just the playability but how *gorgeous* it looked. Like, the finish work and color options they offer are actually inspired compared to the sea of boring sunburst and black guitars most companies churn out for lefties.\n\nI think a lot of brands treat left-handed models like an afterthought \u2013 same boring specs, limited colors, zero personality. Reverend actually seemed to care about the visual appeal, and when you're spending that much money on something that's going to live in your space, aesthetics matter just as much as tone IMO.\n\nHad to order online obviously, but their customer service was solid about letting me return it if the neck didn't feel right. Ended up keeping it because it played beautifully AND looked like a piece of art leaning against my wall. Sometimes you gotta hunt for the brands that actually put thought into their design language.",

          "body": "Young man, I've been playing left-handed for over forty years, and I'll tell you what I learned the hard way. Back in the '80s, I bought my first serious lefty - a Gibson Les Paul Standard that I had to special order through my local shop. Took six months and cost me a premium, but that guitar is still with me today and sounds better than ever.\n\nThe difference was patience and understanding that quality instruments hold their value. I've since added a Martin D-28 lefty and a Fender Stratocaster, all purchased new from authorized dealers. Yes, you pay more upfront, but these established manufacturers know how to build instruments that last decades. \n\nMy advice? Save up for something from Gibson, Fender, or Martin rather than compromising on a budget alternative. The resale value alone justifies the investment, and you'll have an instrument that grows with you rather than something you'll want to replace in two years.",
