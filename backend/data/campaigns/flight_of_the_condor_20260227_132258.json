Do you have any data on the actual number of anime games released per year from, say, the 80s-90s versus now? I'd be curious to see if this is a real trend or just selection bias from remembering the good ones.\n\nFrom what I can find, the mobile gaming market has definitely shifted development priorities toward monetization models that favor gacha mechanics over narrative fidelity. There's probably some economic research on how licensing costs and development budgets have changed that could explain this shift.\n\nI remember enjoying some of the Studio Ghibli collaborations like Ni no Kuni, which seemed to respect the source material's aesthetic and storytelling approach. Have there been any systematic reviews of anime adaptation quality over time? Would be fascinating to see if someone's actually quantified this perceived decline.",

I've been tinkering with recreating some classic game mechanics as weekend projects, and it's surprisingly doable once you break down the core systems. The sprite animation pipeline is straightforward if you approach it methodically.\n\nThere are some decent open-source game engines specifically designed for adventure games too.

Now AAA budgets have exploded while the anime fanbase hasn't scaled proportionally.\n\nMost studios would rather pump out a F2P gacha with whale monetization - much better ROI with less risk. The technical bar is also way higher now. Players expect modern graphics, smooth gameplay, voice acting, etc. A small anime adaptation can't compete with established franchises that have dedicated dev teams.\n\nThat said, there's definitely untapped potential in the indie space.

But you're absolutely right that the quality has tanked with these exploitative gacha games designed to extract maximum money from players.\n\nThe real issue is how these mobile games encourage overconsumption and addictive spending patterns. At least those old Mysterious Cities of Gold games were complete experiences you bought once. Now it's all about psychological manipulation to keep people spending on digital nothing.\n\nI'd love to see more thoughtful, complete anime games again - preferably digital-only to reduce packaging waste. The Ni No Kuni games show it's possible to make something beautiful that respects both the source material AND doesn't rely on predatory monetization schemes.",

I've noticed the same trend with a lot of entertainment products - everything's become about quick monetization instead of quality. It's like how the supplement industry went from actual research-backed products to just slapping buzzwords on garbage and calling it a day.\n\nI think there's definitely still a market for quality anime games, but developers need to put in the actual work instead of looking for shortcuts. Same principle I tell my clients - you can't build real strength with gimmicks, you need consistent effort and proper fundamentals. The gaming industry could learn from that mindset.\n\nWhat got me into fitness gaming was actually some of those older anime-inspired fighting games that had solid mechanics.

The fresh air and natural light can really enhance your appreciation for these beautiful stories. \u2728",

Why spend years developing a quality game when you can slap together a gacha system and milk whales for years? It's basic marketing math - maximum profit for minimum effort.\n\nThe \"good old days\" had plenty of awful anime games that nobody talks about because they were forgettable garbage.

Do you have any data on the actual number of anime games released per year from, say, the 80s-90s versus now? I'd be curious to see if this is a real trend or just selection bias from remembering the good ones.\n\nFrom what I can find, the mobile gaming market has definitely shifted development priorities toward monetization models that favor gacha mechanics over narrative fidelity. There's probably some economic research on how licensing costs and development budgets have changed that could explain this shift.\n\nI remember enjoying some of the Studio Ghibli collaborations like Ni no Kuni, which seemed to respect the source material's aesthetic and storytelling approach. Have there been any systematic reviews of anime adaptation quality over time? Would be fascinating to see if someone's actually quantified this perceived decline.",

Back then, developers had to make the full experience worth the upfront cost - now they just need to hook you long enough to start spending.\n\nIf you're really nostalgic for those old games, you might want to look into game development tools like Unity or Godot. I've been tinkering with recreating some classic game mechanics as weekend projects, and it's surprisingly doable once you break down the core systems. The sprite animation pipeline is straightforward if you approach it methodically.\n\nThere are some decent open-source game engines specifically designed for adventure games too. Way more satisfying than throwing money at whatever low-effort adaptation gets pushed out next.

Now AAA budgets have exploded while the anime fanbase hasn't scaled proportionally.\n\nMost studios would rather pump out a F2P gacha with whale monetization - much better ROI with less risk. The technical bar is also way higher now. Players expect modern graphics, smooth gameplay, voice acting, etc. A small anime adaptation can't compete with established franchises that have dedicated dev teams.\n\nThat said, there's definitely untapped potential in the indie space. Look at what Cuphead did with animation-inspired visuals. I think we'll see more boutique anime games as development tools become more accessible, but the days of every popular series getting a console adaptation are probably over.",

Everything's over-designed with flashy UI elements and cluttered interfaces that completely miss the essence of what made the original art special. Like, imagine if Studio Ghibli let someone make a game that looked like a generic mobile RPG instead of capturing Miyazaki's actual art style.\n\nI think there's definitely still a market for quality adaptations, but publishers need to invest in artists who understand visual storytelling, not just programmers who can copy-paste existing game mechanics.
