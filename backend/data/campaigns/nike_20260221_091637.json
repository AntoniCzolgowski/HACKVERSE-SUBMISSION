      "body": "I've been collecting running shoes for like 8 years now, and I'm genuinely curious if the jump in price between Nike models is actually justified by performance gains or if we're just seeing inflation + hype cycles.\n\nLike, the React cushioning was a game-changer back in the day. Then Zoom, then ReactX, now whatever the new foam tech is. But when I actually run in something from 2019 vs 2024, I'm not sure I feel a massive difference. Maybe I'm just not sensitive enough to it.\n\nThinking specifically about running shoes here since that seems to be what gets discussed most. Are people actually feeling real differences in the tech or have we hit a ceiling where it's mostly marketing?",
