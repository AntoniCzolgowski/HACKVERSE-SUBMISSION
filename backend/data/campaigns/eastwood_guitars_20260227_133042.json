      "body": "So I've been playing left-handed for about 6 years now, and I'm at a point where I want to expand my collection a bit. But every time I go looking for something different\u2014whether it's a baritone, a semi-hollow body, or just something in a different style\u2014the lefty options are basically non-existent at most places.\n\nI know I'm not alone in this. I see posts here all the time from other leftys struggling to find what they want. Some of you seem to have figured out how to navigate this better than others.\n\nSo real talk: What's your strategy? Do you compromise and learn to play righty? Do you special order? Have you found brands or retailers that actually take lefty players seriously and keep decent inventory? I'm genuinely curious how people handle this because it feels like a constant battle.",

          "body": "Have you considered just building your own? I'm serious - if you've got basic woodworking skills and access to decent tools, converting a right-handed guitar isn't that complicated. You'll need to flip the nut, potentially move the bridge depending on the model, and reverse the string order, but it's totally doable for someone with patience.\n\nI've done three conversions over the years and honestly prefer them to anything I could buy off the shelf. You get exactly what you want spec-wise, and the process teaches you a ton about how the instrument actually works. Plus you're not paying the \"lefty tax\" that manufacturers love to slap on.\n\nIf full conversion seems daunting, start with a kit guitar - way cheaper to experiment with and you can set it up left-handed from the beginning. Just my two cents, but waiting around for manufacturers to care about lefties seems like a losing game.",

I've had tremendous success with Elderly Instruments in Michigan - they've special ordered several instruments for me over the decades, including a beautiful Guild D-40 and a Custom Shop Telecaster. Yes, you'll wait 4-6 months, but the result is exactly what you want.\n\nI'd also recommend Southpaw Guitars - they specialize in left-handed instruments and truly understand our needs.

Sweetwater's lefty section is also fairly comprehensive compared to brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nI'd be curious to see actual sales data comparing lefty demand vs. inventory allocation across major retailers.

Find a local luthier who'll build you exactly what you want without the corporate markup.

      "body": "Been thinking about this a lot lately: vintage guitars are amazing, but if you're left-handed, you're basically locked out of most of what this community celebrates. \n\nI know lefty guitars exist from the vintage era\u2014Gibson, Fender, etc. made them\u2014but finding a vintage lefty in decent condition feels nearly impossible. The secondhand market is flooded with righties. Even specialized vintage dealers rarely stock lefty originals.\n\nThis got me wondering: are there other left-handed guitarists here who've tried to build a vintage collection? What's been your experience? Did you:\n\n- Eventually learn to play righty to access vintage gear?\n- Stick to modern instruments because vintage options are too limited?\n- Get lucky and find some rare vintage lefties?\n- Just accept that vintage collecting isn't realistic for your handedness?\n\nIt feels like there's this whole segment of players who are kind of excluded from the vintage guitar hobby, and I'm curious if it's just me noticing this or if it's a real pain point for others.

Sometimes the path of least resistance leads us exactly where we need to be. Plus, you'd know the entire journey of your guitar's energy - from tree to finished instrument to your hands.\n\nThat said, I really feel for lefty players being excluded from this community.

      "body": "Been thinking about this a lot lately: vintage guitars are amazing, but if you're left-handed, you're basically locked out of most of what this community celebrates. \n\nI know lefty guitars exist from the vintage era\u2014Gibson, Fender, etc. made them\u2014but finding a vintage lefty in decent condition feels nearly impossible. The secondhand market is flooded with righties. Even specialized vintage dealers rarely stock lefty originals.\n\nThis got me wondering: are there other left-handed guitarists here who've tried to build a vintage collection? What's been your experience? Did you:\n\n- Eventually learn to play righty to access vintage gear?\n- Stick to modern instruments because vintage options are too limited?\n- Get lucky and find some rare vintage lefties?\n- Just accept that vintage collecting isn't realistic for your handedness?\n\nIt feels like there's this whole segment of players who are kind of excluded from the vintage guitar hobby, and I'm curious if it's just me noticing this or if it's a real pain point for others. Thoughts?",

          "body": "This resonates with me on such a deep level - there's something really beautiful about the energy and intention that gets infused into vintage instruments over decades of being played and loved. I'm actually right-handed but I've been drawn to the spiritual aspect of connecting with these older pieces that carry so much history and soul.\n\nHave you considered that maybe the universe is guiding you toward creating your own legacy with a modern instrument made from sustainable, naturally-aged woods? Sometimes the path of least resistance leads us exactly where we need to be. Plus, you'd know the entire journey of your guitar's energy - from tree to finished instrument to your hands.\n\nThat said, I really feel for lefty players being excluded from this community. There's got to be a more inclusive way to honor the vintage spirit while embracing all players. Maybe starting a lefty vintage appreciation group could manifest more instruments into existence through collective intention?",

          "body": "As a lefty myself, I like to think of it as exclusive VIP access to disappointment. \"Oh wow, a 1959 Les Paul Burst! Is it... oh, it's righty. Of course it is.\" \n\nI've basically become a vintage guitar window shopper. It's like being on a permanent diet at a bakery - everything looks amazing but none of it's for me. At this point I'm convinced vintage lefty guitars are like Bigfoot sightings - people claim they exist but the photographic evidence is always blurry.\n\nMy solution? I tell myself my modern guitars will be vintage someday. In 2080, some poor lefty kid will be desperately hunting for my 2015 Epiphone on the vintage market. Circle of life, my friend. Circle of very limited, frustratingly sparse life.",
