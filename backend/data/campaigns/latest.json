      "body": "This might be obvious to academic folks here, but for anyone (like me) who got frustrated with stats texts that just teach \"here's the formula, use it\" without explaining the *why* behind different approaches\u2014I found the Handbook of the Philosophy of Science (Volume 7, specifically on statistics) surprisingly useful.\n\nIt's a reference handbook edited by Bandyopadhyay and others, published by Elsevier. It covers the foundational stuff: probability theory, what statistical inference actually means philosophically, the epistemology of data analysis, that kind of thing. It's dense and academic, not a textbook you read cover-to-cover, but the chapters are organized by topic so you can jump to whatever's actually bugging you about statistical reasoning.\n\nI grabbed it because I kept having the same philosophical frustrations I mentioned above, and it actually helped clarify why certain tensions exist in how we practice statistics. Not a beginner resource\u2014assumes you know the math already and want to understand the philosophy beneath it.\n\nThought I'd mention it in case anyone else here is at that stage where the standard texts aren't scratching the itch anymore. Has anyone else used reference handbooks like this? Would be curious if there are other good ones people recommend for statistical foundations.",

I ordered one of their handbooks last year for work (different topic) and paid through the nose - like $300+ for what's basically a collection of academic papers you could probably find elsewhere. Half the chapters felt like they were written by different people who never talked to each other, so good luck getting a coherent perspective.\n\nThat said, I feel you on the frustration with stats books that just throw formulas at you. I've been burned so many times buying \"comprehensive\" textbooks that promise to explain the reasoning and then just... don't. At least you're being honest that this one's dense and not beginner-friendly. Most people would oversell it.\n\nJust a heads up - check your library first or see if you can get it through interlibrary loan before shelling out the cash.

The philosophical foundations are crucial - too many executives I worked with would blindly trust whatever statistical analysis crossed their desk without understanding the assumptions baked into the methods.\n\nMight have to dust off my library card and take a look at this volume.

What are we actually inferring? Is the likelihood principle really the right framework? But they matter because they determine what we can and can't claim about our analyses.\n\nI think part of the issue is that academic statistics moved toward foundations and theory, while industry statistics just... moved toward what works. And they're not always the same thing.\n\nHas anyone else felt this tension? Do you think practitioners need to engage more with the philosophy side, or is it actually fine to just use methods that are validated empirically?",

Then when things go wrong (and they always do), nobody knows how to fix it because they never understood it in the first place.\n\nMark my words - this disconnect is going to lead to some major disasters down the road.

      "body": "This might be obvious to academic folks here, but for anyone (like me) who got frustrated with stats texts that just teach \"here's the formula, use it\" without explaining the *why* behind different approaches\u2014I found the Handbook of the Philosophy of Science (Volume 7, specifically on statistics) surprisingly useful.\n\nIt's a reference handbook edited by Bandyopadhyay and others, published by Elsevier. It covers the foundational stuff: probability theory, what statistical inference actually means philosophically, the epistemology of data analysis, that kind of thing. It's dense and academic, not a textbook you read cover-to-cover, but the chapters are organized by topic so you can jump to whatever's actually bugging you about statistical reasoning.\n\nI grabbed it because I kept having the same philosophical frustrations I mentioned above, and it actually helped clarify why certain tensions exist in how we practice statistics. Not a beginner resource\u2014assumes you know the math already and want to understand the philosophy beneath it.\n\nThought I'd mention it in case anyone else here is at that stage where the standard texts aren't scratching the itch anymore. Has anyone else used reference handbooks like this? Would be curious if there are other good ones people recommend for statistical foundations.",

I ordered one of their handbooks last year for work (different topic) and paid through the nose - like $300+ for what's basically a collection of academic papers you could probably find elsewhere. Half the chapters felt like they were written by different people who never talked to each other, so good luck getting a coherent perspective.\n\nThat said, I feel you on the frustration with stats books that just throw formulas at you. I've been burned so many times buying \"comprehensive\" textbooks that promise to explain the reasoning and then just... don't. At least you're being honest that this one's dense and not beginner-friendly. Most people would oversell it.\n\nJust a heads up - check your library first or see if you can get it through interlibrary loan before shelling out the cash. Elsevier loves to price gouge, and reference books like this tend to collect dust after you realize you only needed like three chapters.",

The philosophical foundations are crucial - too many executives I worked with would blindly trust whatever statistical analysis crossed their desk without understanding the assumptions baked into the methods.\n\nMight have to dust off my library card and take a look at this volume.

But if you dig into the epistemology of what we're claiming when we say \"this result is significant,\" it gets murky fast.\n\nThe foundational questions feel almost old-fashioned: What does probability *mean*? What are we actually inferring? Is the likelihood principle really the right framework? But they matter because they determine what we can and can't claim about our analyses.\n\nI think part of the issue is that academic statistics moved toward foundations and theory, while industry statistics just... moved toward what works. And they're not always the same thing.\n\nHas anyone else felt this tension? Do you think practitioners need to engage more with the philosophy side, or is it actually fine to just use methods that are validated empirically?",

Then when things go wrong (and they always do), nobody knows how to fix it because they never understood it in the first place.\n\nMark my words - this disconnect is going to lead to some major disasters down the road.
