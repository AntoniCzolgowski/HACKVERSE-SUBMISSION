      "body": "I've been exploring sound healing more seriously over the past year, mostly with singing bowls and smaller gongs. But I'm curious about stepping up to a larger planetary gong for my practice.\n\nFor those of you working with 36-inch gongs or bigger: How different is the experience? I'm drawn to the idea of the sustained vibration and how it might deepen meditation, but I'm wondering about the learning curve and whether the investment actually translates to better sessions.\n\nDoes anyone work with hand-hammered instruments specifically? I've read that the fine-tuning matters, but curious if that's real or marketing. What's been your experience with instrument quality vs. technique in getting consistent results?\n\nAlso \u2014 space and neighbors \ud83d\ude05 \u2014 how loud are we really talking?",

          "body": "Yo! I've been incorporating sound therapy into my recovery routine for about 6 months now - game changer for muscle tension and sleep quality. Haven't gone as big as a 36\" gong yet, but I've used some larger bowls at my yoga studio.\n\nFrom what I've experienced, the deeper vibrations definitely hit different - you can literally feel it in your chest and core muscles. It's like a full-body massage from the inside out. For meditation and recovery sessions, the sustained resonance keeps you locked in that zone way longer than smaller instruments.\n\nThat said, I'd be super cautious about the \"planetary tuning\" claims - sounds like potential marketing fluff to me. The physical properties of size and quality craftsmanship probably matter way more than mystical frequency stuff. \n\nAnd yeah dude, neighbors are definitely gonna hear a 36\" gong lol. Maybe look into some acoustic treatment for your space first? You don't want to ruin the zen vibes with noise complaints.",
