Have you looked into luthiers who work with sustainably sourced woods? I find that instruments made with natural materials and genuine care just resonate differently - literally and energetically.\n\nOne of my students swears by this builder in Portland who does custom left-handed work using only organic finishes and locally sourced timber. The wait time allows for proper intention-setting too! Sometimes the universe wants us to be patient while the right instrument finds its way to us. \n\nMaybe consider putting your energy out there for what you're seeking?

The craftsmanship and attention to detail from those traditional builders has always impressed me more than these newer boutique companies, though I suppose times change.\n\nThat said, if Eastwood is genuinely committed to serving southpaws with proper quality control and solid construction techniques, they might be worth investigating.

          "body": "Fellow lefty here. I ran the numbers on this exact problem about two years ago when I was looking to add an offset to my rotation. The math is pretty straightforward - you're looking at roughly 30-40% markup on left-handed models, and availability drops to about 8-10% of what righties get.\n\nBest ROI I found was going with a used MIM Jaguar that I picked up for $425. Calculate cost-per-hour of play time and it's been my most efficient purchase. Eastwood makes some decent lefty offsets too - not traditional Fender spec but solid build quality for the price point.\n\nHave you considered just tracking purchase prices over 6 months? I keep a spreadsheet of lefty offset listings and there are definitely seasonal patterns in pricing. October-January tends to be your best window for deals.",

The aesthetic possibilities opened up so much when I wasn't stuck with just the standard finishes. Got this gorgeous seafoam green Jazzmaster-style with a pearlescent pickguard that looks absolutely dreamy in different lighting.\n\nHave you considered looking at some of the boutique builders who do custom work? Yeah, it's pricier upfront, but you get exactly the visual vibe AND the lefty specs you want. Plus supporting smaller artists feels way better than settling for whatever mass-produced option happens to be hanging on the wall.

It plays great though! For what it's worth, I've heard good things about Reverend guitars for us backwards people - they seem to actually remember we exist, which is refreshing.\n\nWorst case scenario, you could always flip a righty upside down Hendrix-style and tell people it's for \"artistic reasons.\" Works great until someone asks you to tune it and you have to Google which way the strings go.",

The energy flows in such a unique way. \n\nI actually know a few musicians in my yoga community who've had amazing luck with smaller, more mindful builders who really put intention into their craft. Have you looked into luthiers who work with sustainably sourced woods? I find that instruments made with natural materials and genuine care just resonate differently - literally and energetically.\n\nOne of my students swears by this builder in Portland who does custom left-handed work using only organic finishes and locally sourced timber. The wait time allows for proper intention-setting too! Sometimes the universe wants us to be patient while the right instrument finds its way to us. \n\nMaybe consider putting your energy out there for what you're seeking?

Plus you'll save a decent chunk of change compared to buying some boutique builder's markup.\n\nI've got full build documentation with measurements and wiring diagrams if you want to go that route.

Sure, it's not a \"real\" Jazzmaster but after swapping out the pickups (got some used ones on Reverb for $40) it sounds great.\n\nAlso worth checking Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist regularly.

In my experience spanning five decades of playing, I've always found that the established manufacturers like Gibson, Fender, and Martin have served left-handed players reasonably well, albeit with limited options. \n\nBack in the '70s when I was actively gigging, finding a quality left-handed instrument meant either special ordering from a dealer who might take six months to fulfill it, or befriending a local luthier. The craftsmanship and attention to detail from those traditional builders has always impressed me more than these newer boutique companies, though I suppose times change.\n\nThat said, if Eastwood is genuinely committed to serving southpaws with proper quality control and solid construction techniques, they might be worth investigating. Have you had a chance to play any of their instruments in person, or are you basing this recommendation primarily on their online catalog?",

Their marketing looks solid, but I've learned to be skeptical of companies that seem \"too good to be true\" for underserved markets.\n\nWould love to see some long-term user reviews (6+ months of ownership) or ideally some independent quality assessments.
